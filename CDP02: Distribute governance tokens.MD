## Abstract

The governance tokens ($CHI / CHI Tokens) to control the DAO will be distributed among the founders of the project.

## Proposal

The total supply of 100.000.000.000 CHI Tokens will be distributed among the founders of the project to create the first version of the DAO.

Wallet: 0xa4910a7F681b2e0fae71555a69491a0cDc048EA7  
Current amount:100.000.000.000 CHI Tokens  
New amount: 33.333.333.334 CHI tokens

Wallet: 0x03aF14dF1B69A77c44793C6822b922a9B2c2A2f2  
Current amount:0 CHI Tokens  
New amount: 33.333.333.333 CHI tokens

Wallet: 0xA727a7818fBBaFe6C168F743395bb3bcEf750F79  
Current amount: 0 CHI Tokens  
New amount: 33.333.333.333 CHI tokens

The transaction will be executed by wallet 0xa4910a7F681b2e0fae71555a69491a0cDc048EA7 after the CHI Network DAO approves this proposal.

## Rationale

The CHI Tokens ($CHI) will be replaced during the TGE (Token Generation Event) and limited to internal use among the founders of CHI Network DAO.  
  
Holders of CHI Token ($CHI) are not allowed to transfer the tokens without approval from the DAO.

The tokens will be redistributed with updated weights during the TGE (Token Generation Event).
