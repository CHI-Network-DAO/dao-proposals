## Rationale

The DAO is already and therefore this proposal is retroactive and already executed.  
  
The CHI Tokens ($CHI) will be replaced during the TGE (Token Generation Event) and limited to internal use among the founders of CHI Network DAO.  
  
The DAO can be transformed with EVM Crispr or replaced after approval of the DAO.
