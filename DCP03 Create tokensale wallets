## Abstract

There are MultiSig wallets created for the funds that will be raised during the private sale.

## Proposal

A GNOSIS Safe is created on the Ethereum, BNB Chain and Polygon network as a MultiSign wallet for the funds that will be raised during the private sale.  
  
Polygon: 0x74328d2…..2842F  
Ethereum: 0x15184……27744  
BNB Chain: 0x8b65……2A9F8  
  
Signers (⅔ required)

- 0xA727a7818fBBaFe6C168F743395bb3bcEf750F79  
- 0xa4910a7F681b2e0fae71555a69491a0cDc048EA7  
- 0x03aF14dF1B69A77c44793C6822b922a9B2c2A2f2

Full wallet addresses will be exposed after the TGE (Token Generation Event).

## Rationale

Transactions need to be signed by 2 out of 3 wallets.  
  
The wallets required for signing are controlled by the founders of CHI Network DAO
