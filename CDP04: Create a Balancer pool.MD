## Abstract

The creation of a Balancer pool to test and monitor the performance of the protocol for the use of CHI Cash.

## Proposal

A Balancer pool is created as one of the building blocks for CHI Cash. The CHI Cash token will be backed by a weighted basket of various assets. Balancer protocol allows the creation of liquidity pools with custom weights (%). Rebalancing is performed by the protocol by arbitrage trading.
